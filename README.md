# Tak

This project is a simulator for the sublime strategy game Tak created by Fames Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss based on the fantasy novel 'The Wise Man's Fear'.

Tak's rules are fairly simple and easy to catch up on. Give it a shot if you haven't already, you can find everything you need to know [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheapassgames/tak-a-beautiful-game).

This project is not primarily designed with human players in mind but as a playground for getting a foot into machine learning. It provides a simple interface so you can hook your AI in and let it play.  
If you just want to enjoy a relaxing round of Tak, I first and foremost recommend playing against real people on a real table. If you are scared by real-life contact, first of all, I feel ya. Second, maybe give it a try regardless. It might be more enjoyable than you'd think.  
Other than that, there's plenty of decent alternatives with a decent interface online where you can play e.g. [TakWeb](https://www.playtak.com/).
